id: path-traversal
message: Potential Path Traversal vulnerability detected. User input is being used to construct file paths without validation.
severity: hint
language: Ruby
note: |
  Path Traversal (Directory Traversal) occurs when user input is used to construct file paths
  without proper validation. This allows attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
  Validate and sanitize file paths, and use File.basename() or similar functions.

rule:
  any:
    - pattern: Rails.root.join($$$, $VAR, $$$)
    - pattern: File.join($$$, $VAR, $$$)
    - pattern: send_file $VAR
